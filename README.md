# esx_truckerjob

Trucker job for ESX
When you have the job "trucker" you can go take delivery missions at the warehouse.
The script gives you a random zone between Los Santos and Blaine County.

In each zone you have 10 possible delivery points given randomly.
With each delivery, the script sends you on a new delivery or asks you to return to the deposit
A max of delivery following is configurable in client / main.lua by default to 10 max

When returning to the depot the condition of the truck is checked and the costs of repairs are removed from your salary.
If you lose your truck, you pay for it.

It is possible to stop a mission in court by returning to the depot.

You do not receive your salary until the return of the truck to the deposit and after verification of the state of the latter.
